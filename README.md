## Mission

We've got a simple mission: to eliminate inequalities and discrimination in the tech field.
Women in computing were among the first programmers in the early 20th century and contributed substantially to the industry. As technology and practices have evolved, the role of women as programmers has changed and history has downplayed their achievements.
Today, gender inequality and the lack of women in IT is an established fact.

Adacodes is a platform for sharing resources, providing the tools to expand knowledge and networking. The platform presents a list of opportunities and events in Berlin that mainly target women, FLINTA*, women of colour and migrant women. Results are filtered by type, divided into events, groups, training opportunities, job opportunities and support, and displayed as dots on a map or in a simple list. The user can propose new contributions once registered, the contributions are then checked by an admin who can eventually approve and publish them.
